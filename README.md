# Hi, I'm Aidan McGohan
I'm currently in my 3rd year at Wright State University for a B.A. in Computer Science 🖥️
## Projects
### Personal To-do List Giver (title w.i.p)
I am currently working on a project that randomizes what tasks I *should* do, whether its studying a country's history, going for a hike, or skateboarding.

### Project 2 (GameMaker Studio)
Currently learning how to use GameMaker Studio by making a short Earthbound-like narrative to understand the basics of the engine.
