# 👋 Hi, I'm Aidan McGohan!
I'm currently in my 3rd year at Wright State University for a B.A. in Computer Science 🖥️

## Projects
### Personal To-do List Giver (title w.i.p) 📝
I am currently working on a Java project that randomizes what tasks I *should* do, whether its studying a country's history, going for a hike, or skateboarding.

### Project 2 (GameMaker Studio) 🎮
Currently learning how to use GameMaker Studio by making a short Earthbound-like narrative to understand the basics of the engine.

### HTML Portfolio 📷
In my freetime, I like to do photography and graphic design, so the best way to combine my hobbies with my career, why not design a website to showcase my interests?
